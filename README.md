I'm calling it a day at I4. Odin suggests I should complete I4 but in accordance with  my perforamnce so far, I'm going to leave it incomplete, and hopefully it doesn't bite me in the ass. 

This has been an awesome walkthrough and I've learned a lot. I'm ending right before the last I3 task, "Listing All Tags". That's where to pick up if I'm starting from where I left off. However, I suggest starting over. There were parts I didn't fully understand and reiteration has helped me quite a bit so far. Peace. 

One more thing. I was supposed to push to Heroku. I followed the instructions liked at the project page linked above, sidestepping the parts I recognized to, save for changing that line in Gemfile, and wasn't able to push to Heroku, so I still don't understand Heroku at all.
